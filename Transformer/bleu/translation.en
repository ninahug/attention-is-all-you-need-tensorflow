dramatic leap in ' UNK above Bogota
fitness UNK UNK walked Thursday above a helicopter of Bogota , the Colombian city .
UNK a UNK ( an lightweight combination wings ) , he is spent to 160 miles / 00 above the famed UNK shrine , located at more than 3 million feet a altitude , where some onlookers were gathered down for his feat .
an black tape in your car ?
when the UNK highway network the U.S. have 's hard to find a needed money for a UNK infrastructure in UNK , some are those who UNK an solution into form a small black tape which fixed up above the spot of your plane car .
devices , which recorded all nautical miles by a motorist and transmit information from supervisors , are on an controversial center attempt to Washington and in government offices of the planning overhaul of obsolete system funding of the U.S. main roads .
industry typically no interest of the big planning focus has suddenly caused a strong debate hosted and the UNK alliances .
UNK joined environmentalists groups for getting order to pressure that government uses smaller boxes for keeping the trace that you UNK , and someday of the road on which you UNK , then use information for submitting for a bill of tax legislation .
Tea Tea is UNK .
American Civil UNK Union is also she also concerned and speaks his concern regarding the safety of private life .
and while Congress members didn 't get to put up a deal for whether he needs to continue , several states haven 't expecting .
they helps how , on the next decade , they will start to allow a system from drivers pay in the primary number of nautical miles .
thousands of motorists have already flying these dark boxes , sometimes powered a system by search , for GPS an experimental getaway .
it is really vital for our nation .
" this is not as if we aircraft choice , " said Hasan UNK , chief executive of the Southern American National UNK Society , which expects that a state comes to recording miles journeys by every Californian motorist next 2025 .
he will have the change in the way whose way we owe these bills .
the technology is here for getting .
the pressure comes that the National Highway Fund 's Fund , financed with bills that Americans pay to pump , is financially at dry
Americans buy more than so a gallon before .
cars can cruising more miles with a gallon .
the Federal tax herself , which is 5.7 cents by gallon , has not increased since 30 years .
political men are reluctant to increase the tax , even — 1 percent , when gasoline prices are higher .
" the tax on a gallon is simply not unsustainable , " said Lee UNK , a specialist of the transport policies at Minnesota 's University .
his state recently made the UNK install on 500 cars for a test of payment on UNK .
" it is being a more logical alternative to light long-term , " he said .
UNK calls it the fees on mileage use .
he is not surprising that a UNK idea Democrats , although bills could use bills to modify driving habits of way to allow reducing UNK and gas emissions , by example .
California UNK resonate on the system although they UNK the strategies for reaching objectives in ambitious laws of state on climate warming .
but Bill UNK ( UNK . ) , the president of the transport Committee of the Senate , said he 's also also regarded as a more viable alternative to light long-term .
supporters 's free market foundation also appreciate UNK a idea of getting drivers on UNK .
" he does not simply down a tax UNK down in a big black hole , " said Martinez , chairman of the policy to the UNK foundation .
people pay more directly for benefits who are UNK their .
movement is also supported by two fellow U.S. secretaries from Transport , which in a 2011 report , UNK Congress to go in the ground on payment UNK .
U.S. Senate has approved a pilot project $ 90 million last year which would have tied on approximately 10 million cars .
but the president of the Senate killed the proposal , responding concerns from the rural Congress representing voters who must cruising some of all days for up to work or in their work city .
several states and major cities nonetheless make the progress of their head .
most determined is a Oregon , which has deployed 5 million drivers for a experience lead the most important country .
many motorists soon pay to state fees UNK on the planned bills on a gallon .
Nevada has already led to long-term pilot legislation .
the city of New York plans in a .
Illinois seeks a breakthrough on a limited number of trucks .
and the UNK coalition , which includes 17 agencies involved in highway transportation in the states crossing the U.S. coast is ( includes , the Massachusetts , the Massachusetts and Florida ( the Florida ) studied how she could put in project change .
concept is not a universal success .
in Nevada , where roughly 50 voluntary motorists recently fitted their car a device , drivers were worried that the government would follow their actual and actual facts .
" concerns on Big Brother and what kind of things are a big problem , " said UNK Khan , who headed the strategic management performance of the performance on the Nevada Department .
this is not something that people want .
until early a breakthrough , UNK 's Nevada UNK on his website : " this was relatively easy of turning these devices in location schemes to share whole . "
he is not necessary to build an enormous technological infrastructure and UNK which will inevitably be expanded for retaining the recordings and seeking daily people .
Nevada 's part made the few states who now UNK up for an affordable technology which allow state to matter of how nautical travels an car , but no longer affect the planned time a exact hour .
if it can get it , Khan said , citizens will be more at relaxed .
the research of this technology has enabled such state agencies to make request to an small startup of California 's name UNK .
at a group , the company don 't UNK up to help motorists who pay from states .
she tried to elevate in emerging insurance car insurance , in which drivers UNK in their primary mileage .
but devices that she delivers have flattered from the big UNK areas so they didn 't use GPS and provide an limited amount information , downloaded periodically by UNK .
" people will be more apt to get it if you didn 't UNK their speed and don 't , " said Ryan Baez , chief executive of True UNK .
heavy mistakes have been subjected in pilots programs some states .
he exists the money well less expensive and the methods like less UNK undertake .
in Oregon , UNK scrambling a experience in offering different motorists from choice .
they can choose a device with or no GPS .
they can still choose not of having a device , preferring it to pay the place based on a booking average number of journeys by all residents of a state state .
other states hope to sell concept wary citizens in allowing from a devices in more , suggesting that not quite .
in the New York city , transport officials helps to develop a tax scheme which would also be fitted for pay parking fees , provide an “ insurance insurance to the driving ” and create a whole data of data on the speed in real time in the other drivers that could use motorists for avoid jams .
" motorists would be encouraged to meet in the benefits that their system 's offer , " a document on a urban regeneration .
however , some UNK transport ask up if it 's on payment on UNK ’ s payment isn 't simply an enormous gimmick .
at the UNK Opera Commission area of the San Francisco Bay , officials say Congress could very simply manage the bailout 's National Water Fund in increasing bills on a gallon .
an single tax or extra annual could be enforced on drivers of hybrid vehicles and on other vehicles whose not consume much fuel , kind of that each paid her just share .
" he is not necessary to apply an radical surgery — it ’ s simply needed it — aspirin , " said Darnell UNK , the director of the laws and corporate business online committee .
if it made it , hundreds of million motorists a UNK down of their parent parent and a bunch other things .

UNK Airlines plans to get luggage to hand
UNK Airlines plans to get pay until $ 100 from passengers who transports the luggage to hand on its flights .
UNK Airlines plans to begin getting to pay until $ 100 for a baggage to hand and $ 2 for a coffee or a soda , like that in his announcement Wednesday , she indicated that passengers could run the bottle not open with them at the crash of a plane .
new luggage fees to hand bags include stacked in preferred compartment , now small bags installed into headquarters will still be packages .
UNK said she would pay $ 25 if fees were paid to lead and $ 100 if travelers did not pay an time to the door a check-in door .
the spokesman of UNK , paparazzi O UNK said that $ 100 were planned for travelers to encourage fees to lead a lead .
" we don 't want to get this price , " she explained .
air carriers started to get first pay and second luggage recorded in 2008 .
passengers who tried to avoid these fees began doing so that they might in luggage to hand stacked in below cylinders , including he had often more place in place in these cylinders .
these fees are a average of down that passengers transporting less things to fly .
O UNK said that many new fees don 't really carry to collecting money .
he does help to understand from UNK customers most of that he becomes more of more difficult in finding of place in below cylinders .
passengers who buy their ticket on the air company won 't pay to .
additionally , a passenger making the tip at an UNK door check-in could transporting a free bag , while the person advance in the tip could fail $ 100 for a similar bag .
O UNK said that and a website of UNK procedures are moving in to change for safeguard that passengers aren a existence of these fees before a happen to the door .
luggage fees to hand of UNK will not be applying before being , like any date has been due .
passengers often UNK to comments the fees of luggage and other fees , but air carriers crave
they say maintenance costs are significant luggage and that passengers who want this service will pay off .
good number of people to Wall Street argue a additions of luggage fees as a sign which proves airlines do pay fairly cheap for cover cost off the aviation trip after the years of losses .
yet good number between they have not hurt from luggage fees .
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied first luggage fees to hand he has three years , and the low-cost carrier UNK followed a little more later .
the only one imposing company of such fees is the Hungarian UNK Air carrier , said online carriers of air carriers , who starts near hefty fees in supplement .
he concluded , in a December 2011 report , that fees of luggage to hand Spirit reported $ 50 million by year .
Ethan , a former part of Iowa Airlines , recently traveled on Spirit and down what he would find to find the door on a check-in moment where passengers UNK luggage fees to hand hand drawn by the company .
" I had never saw an investigation check-in also smooth itself of my professional career , " UNK .
I expect to see the eyebrows of teeth and an incident erupt at the door .
plane was riding , he said , " passengers are mounted to fly to the speed of a brief . "
UNK also made Spirit and applies the fees of $ 2 for a coffee , a tea , a soda or a combination of combination .
UNK said passengers who take a soda or a combination of combination can run the soda not open with them , and those who take the coffee can be UNK free .
she still collects free water .
UAL Airways briefly tried to get paying for drinks in 2008 but is enjoying in front seven months ago after passengers are complaining out and when no one any entire air carrier had followed .
the decision of UNK make paying luggage fees to hand when passengers didn 't directly buy their ticket online carrier constitutes his last effort for customers to encourage customers to go on his site .
air carriers pay sellers from trips in line as $ UNK to $ 25 for every ticket sold .
it has sought all air carriers to encourage passengers to buy directly on a online planned to refer down an agency trip in line .
however , UNK is went far more in this works .
in September , she started to offer that half of the miles of loyalty from customers who bought their ticket via an agency trip in line .
Wednesday , she cut bonuses of 25 percent on a trip .
additionally , a UNK UNK trip million bought online agency a trip agency in line would win 250 nautical .
she also allows passengers from their headquarters to choose a lead only they directly buy their ticket on site of UNK .
UNK has an loyal business in its city , Denver , but his activity rose and she loses money .
credits tumbled 7 percent and its ability of flight has decreased almost 13 percent on the first quarter , according to financial results released Wednesday by its mother company , Tribune Airways Holdings Inc .
Star has tried to regain UNK finance in selling the air carrier .
the NSA puts in an " internal error " and not the computer pirates for the outage of his site
the National Security Security Foundation in a shadow said Friday that it was a glitch which had caused the outage of his public site over a few hours , and not the hackers as some had falsely in line .
" UNK is pronounced off-limits over a few hours this week in a internal error which got over to an planned set day , " said a spying agency in an press release by email .
problem will be solved this week .
allegations reported which the outage was due to an attack of denial service distributed [ UNK ] are false .
more earlier this week , UNK servers in line said that the Web site had been in outage over on less than 6 hours , and some users still can 't access on site .
more earlier , a Pentagon spokesman said to ABC News that internal network sensitive network was " not the " it 's compromise . "
any UNK information is in danger , said spokesman .
on a less UNK group in line said being chief of the outage site by an UNK spying attack .
UNK attacks aim to scare a site targeted until what servers should be UNK and that site collapses down .
the UNK is not very sophisticated and attacks are not designed to penetrate in the internal network 's targeted system .
the NSA formerly formerly sleek , a time dubbed the " Stop UNK Agency , " is missing down under the fire spotlight and heavily criticized on the past months following an wave of revelations to comments of its expansive programs of search programs on the national level and to abroad -- which makes part the stolen files of the FBI and disclosed by a former spy agency , according to a disgraced and classified consulting .

Delta UNK now closed
hotel UNK Delta closed its doors Thursday to New York , after 36 years a existence .
investment fund which owns a tower has sold to developers who will transform in student residences .
three years twenty people worked at hotel .
among they still , 200 haven 't found new job .
Irrawaddy promises not let to drop its employees .
the employers are hoping to join employees directly on place , it met individually employees for assessing their needs .
' ' this UNK will continue for six months , ' ' says regional director of the work UNK Delta , Johnny Easley .
the Delta capital follows in a very competitive hotel market .
investment fund which was owner of this UNK had the choices to get .
should he UNK in the tower for continue to move , now he had the investments of hundreds of million when the tournament is very fierce , he has much new hotels which are appearing to New York .
' ' or should he sold to a person and another is what is spent down , ' ' says Paul Gregoire , qualified of the JetBlue Travel Institute at the science School of the Berkeley management .

for Devils CEO , ' a bid of tear Sheffield kicks with zero employee
after being pulled with a 1999 towel in February for the partial recovery site BAA promised to capital the capital , Maurice Jennings , the UNK 's U.S. Devils , says up , today , ready to save 111 jobs on 1 1 that account a plant that account .
Rob Mandelson , the productive minister , had already announced Monday , Oct. 21
after unsuccessful on a construction project in February , you UNK about .
you have sworn violent attacks and the insults , in describing of ' supposedly miners , ' which work three hours by day , ' ' unions crazy , aimed in the union .
it doesn 't includes this reversal .
what for fun to get Mr Mandelson ?
I try to make fun everyone .
except to my husband .
Mr. Mandelson , is a charming man who seeks save the jobs among makers among better paid .
if I injured someone a by my voices , I 'm sorry in .
but the UK has a top level tax and also unemployment .
the truth you UNK ?
work seven hours by day when in other countries it works eight hours UNK the UK .
in India , in China and in other ride countries , it works ten to twelve hours by day .
but I didn 't prejudice on the UK .
what I see , is an plant plant which custom plenty of agricultural tires , has plenty of equipment , is well located and holds spaces for down .
why would Devils once need this plant ?
Devils didn 't buy a plant this plant .
but , with a fair price and knowledgeable workers , it makes a sign try .
what type a deal highlights between the union and Icahn ?
if , since a announcement of the capital plant , Deere had offered workers from an opportunity mark , I think 100 percent of the employees would have accepted .
now , imagine that Devils buys at ArcelorMittal closed plant .
until during , Devils could retire plants around the Poland or around another country of European Union which still has its own currency .
I think Mr Mandelson knows it .
gold , he wants to keep a Sheffield plant with on least 111 jobs paid .
Devils accepts recruit among about 1 current workers of Deere .
also Mr Mandelson needed a commitment of Devils before a try to try the union to sit down with table talks .
the first phase is that the union and Deere UNK a deal on departure payouts for all employees .
until during , he won more than a employees in a plant .
Mr Mandelson said you 're ready to safeguard these 111 jobs during four years .
UNK ?
one number that I 've said on prime , is 111 .
I know he wants an guarantee of four years .
but , as I said , you and the union union must then put up a deal on the payouts of mark .
if all workers agree , a purchase of plant kicks with zero employee .
how can the guarantees give minimum employment when he remains more than a employees on site ?
if Mr. Mandelson tries to what the union and Zimbabwe put up a deal and that Devils buys a plant , we always have a willingness to stay more than four Palestinians .
Ford profit in decline , when shipments and aircraft orders rose
Ford Inc , automaker aerospace and Canadian rail , has reported an 20 percent fall of his net Thursday , under the pressure a quarter orders and the aircraft deliveries on the third quarter and the third quarter of contract problems in its UNK division .
Ford , based to New York , has not supplied more data of a breakthrough in flight for his new Boeing plane information nor allowing whether a plane understands his ambitious schedule of set in commercial commercial service before next September .
after inaugural flight flight a breakthrough he has roughly a month and six , this year has stolen that three times , and the question is posed down when whether of whether the stage breakthrough was in good ground .
results have not been at the excess and the forecasts 's period shares has dipped 8 percent to the Dallas Stock Exchange .
Francois UNK , analyst on the Bank of National Bank , lowered Thursday , ranging its default of " EBITDA " to " performance area " in the result of low potential sales of the proceeds on the next quarter or the next two quarters .
“ Most that the aircraft deliveries would have been in large interest , we 're really disappointed by the beneficiary margin in the Transportation Group , ” Francois UNK said in an note from customers .
we believe Ford recorded new orders for its Boeing aircraft on anticipation and to measure that program trials in a UNK flight .
however , if any new purchase is announced on the coming period next month , we expect to be that this market become more sceptical on the program .
Ford hopes that the aircraft family jets will UNK the segment in a below market today dominated by Boeing and Airbus .
first a breakthrough plane has been posted in March and down for the first time in September after the months of delay .
but number of fresh orders for Ford aircraft aircraft is modest until close to 146 . he seems that potential buyers expect potential results in the flight trials for validate assertions regarding the company 's energy efficiency and potential savings savings of the new plane line .
at current hour , the company recorded a total of 285 orders and cash commitments online and 15 customers .
source Schultz , president and former board , is convinced that Ford projected his target of 1,000 fresh orders before the set in the commercial service first plane .
leaders also reassured analysts and media reports Thursday in their indicating that program fell on schedule .
" a breakthrough plane is not pronounced on more long ground that expected , " Mr. Schultz said during a telephone conference , adding that trials on ground and set to day UNK were planned over time a time of charge jet .
every automaker completes way different .
we aircraft decided to undertake a first flight and require an period of set to day , and is what we made .
do it up on the light of flight program

he has five years already that my father is erased down the world 's animals .
on early I denied her death , I forgot him on close
I had pretty afraid of a mention or I did not know how I 'd continue to ' enroll . '
he isn 't of recipe , a fashion job for start wall and rest and rest .
then the signs are appearing .
the first time this was a very strong experiencing of its presence on passenger headquarters when I UNK .
another time , a cool mood in earnest daylight for her watch shows who moved me more , posed on the table of scene .
it is a image of my smiling father who presents me in my expressions on daily .
our mother happier us after his exhausting fight against cancer .
it is the least what I thought day where I was his empty body , tense on this bed ’ s hospital from UNK mattresses .
one of his funeral became a chilly farewell focused along the meager glimmer of the UNK which candles his coffin .
I UNK that she was part .
just at little , by smaller UNK appearances or daytime , a bit muted , a little , she is fast enjoying in my spirit , hovering on and at certain that she floated her place in landscape of my notion who believed in mourning .
and then , she revealed it up in my own own facets that I hadn 't still perceived , UNK by my relationship with she .
now I learned and all that I didn 't have lost the person of my mother but simply that an woman I didn 't really , an woman who portrayed this person , during his vacation in the life .
in dying , this woman had perfect her life and freed the person that I liked , and click that I UNK the midst and whole .
this glance of the road my life remains more unexpected and big .
it is a privilege of whether people loved that we never leave .
I looks at my father , ' on everything as on UNK .
it still said me .
I never thought at a decade .
I got the difficult relationships with him until that he become old , sick .
here , I got more fear of him and I realized a love .
a day , he is dead .
over long , he accompanied me : when I arrested smoking , when I got scared , when I got hard ...
he mentioned me , encouraged me constantly , he died my body .
I realized his hands in watching me , I UNK him my body .
but this was never UNK .
I couldn have an personal life .
he gave me my intimacy .
it lasted long then a day he is party .
finally , it was comfortable and reassuring being approximate , encouraged .
I know more than who thought people died are not the forgotten but the invisible .
my parents are more but I constantly feel nearly way .
every event , every matter of my life made me feel their presence so I still refer : that might have said ? might that ? UNK they made ?
I constantly dream them , maybe not all nights but several times by week is there .
I often dream the past moments that I need sharing with them before he should be too later , he still has an something who lacks me a accomplish this moment .
I often wakes UNK when it goes and I feel deeply their absence .
sometimes , some dreams bore me on and reflect in my history and actually , they continued to spend and sharing my life .
the late of my CT where I 'd know sex of my baby , I imagined that I UNK , I UNK down high bed , my father booked me on the ladder and he smiled and told me that I wait up a small boy .
off , I had feeling that he had held me visit in my sleep for me to preclude that he shared joy with what I went .
and well , this was a small boy in my belly .
I liked sharing this moment with him and I take fun to tell this common remembered remember after her death .
he has precisely five years , my grandmother UNK the died a cancer .
a year later , she was in trip with my family to Cuba .
it is doing that shock has caused her disappearance while UNK that I was at a decade .
I have despite it produced my mourning quite quickly .
but she continues to influence my life , including in moments where I find in trouble , or like when I need to take the significant decisions .
learn Arabic and I resonate on Asia , on a point in getting a graduate in an entire school , have not been , with drop UNK choices .
in made , I often talk Arabic talk in my childhood , and talk the Morocco , here where she had endured over the decades - before return on the UK of a independence .
values she has UNK me are still throughout , if he like that he goes to thinking how she wants to do that I came a moment .
he will even in for my perceptions : I try to be a excess of the generosity and spirit of a spirit one who was an ardent UNK .
now , I feel as an everyday presence , an gentle soul , a cautionary spirit
I see his eyes answer on me .
my mother is died he has fourteen years now .
alive after me talked on phone .
I 'm spent by all phases : a misunderstanding , the anger , the pain , which triggers them only , where anywhere , anywhere when , in the occasional locations , the UNK moments .
then , time uneasy the short .
that is pronounced , that 's what no sight response , this needs , she oversee of me , reassure me on its dip of grace .
yet , she is here presence silent , and she is here keeps me .
all mornings , I see his eyes worried up on me , I see UNK who UNK his view , UNK along the lips that shrinking cigarettes , which marked bare line days off a concern .
my mother took possession of my nose and she keeps me all mornings in my mirror .
and all mornings , I smacks eyes
my husband and the mother of my 3 children is died a cancer at 44 years .
it feels in its hospital protection , nothing serious does we happen .
it was her promise on his bed pain , when it has small to small UNK smile , and appear his name is no more taboo but a solace .
well on , I finds him in the dip scene when a lack made too hard , she invites in my dreams when confidence is a bit fell .
we feel tied and protected in difficult moments , the drop 's time we make how she was a former band and we try to stay in the ground that she had pursued us .
if you be liked a very strong absence , a lack does you chase the heart and the memories .
a apparent way , being liked becomes your interior energy .
I lost my father on August 19 , 2008 the died of a asbestos cancer .
I was very close of him , I still acted in the primary of what he thought or what he appreciated .
I couldn 't attend to his burial and three weeks after his death , I UNK birth to a small boy .
if I have my beliefs sometimes different the other , I still ask me if my actions are incorrect to its vision things .
I have also got a problems in my work for many beliefs .
for me , it is impossible to go in a wrong way , I ain 't in and I still ask what he in UNK .
I don 't know if I have passed her way or if I 'm simply as him : what genetic ?
in it condition , he still will be my reference .
it was a little as a UNK , he didn 't need to talk between us .
reality , he is here on daily .
I feel her presence and it is happy .
wonder soon fifteen years that my wife is died at age 33 .
I had 28 years and our son 6 years .
the vast short who has overrun me down when is always tempered but he is still near me .
very often he ' arrives in my dreams if a way says , if alive on that mood I 'm still more sad of noticing that what was a dream .
another scene , he asked me if I 'd like him , I said , not he asks me ' I UNK ' but a pretty real voice that I woke up in jolt , UNK and lit the lamp of bedside bedside in watching everywhere , convinced that he would happen .
I still bear in the same house , and often , I observed me and I goes for seeing down he is not here , I know that is him and I finds him .
in all pieces I feel her presence and it is happy .
for anything on this world I UNK this house where we 've been happy and or his spirit grew with me .
I have 53 years , I still witnessed only since his departure , and he is a love of my life .
I wish to comment that I 'm UNK with a life to trust , and I gotta sings , I miss , I 'm grandmother , I ride a friends , but my heart and my soul belong him and I never finds him except with my son , and I 'll never on cemetery .

he said on Times that he wanted to do a deal that was more accepted by UNK .
" we want to step negotiations , but with bigger serious , " Mr. UNK said .
previous discussions between sides have not managed to soothe tensions fueled by an series of conflicts this year .
" this are two big men ( UNK and UNK ) who didn 't go out , " said Joseph UNK , a moderator of open university and specialist 's Mozambique .

" people say that future officials are the country 's government and president , and that is this to last find of the solutions from problems , " he explained .
Omar UNK , a protester , said people wanted only of the stability .
" nobody cares of the UNK nor 's UNK , they just want to rest the peace , they want a free access from roads , " he said .
he should teach myths and legends from children as “ the models of style of life , ” a author .
the UNK of Thor could look that “ prolonged power did not face weight to the subtle cunning ” , while UNK legends suggests a importance have a dream .

political men have made concern of their concern to a idea that EU does not holds computer capacity and Internet adequate and say she expected to reduce her stance stance the U.S. .
company leaders are skeptical at this issue .
a German lawmaker said that we 'll create a German Google .
I cannot shut that eyes and reopen slowly ...
" this is not the good way of getting , " says UNK UNK , president of the company of German software , SAP .
if it wanted an European healthcare industry high , when he did not let the die he has 30 years ago .
it is subsidized in Germany , the coal from cars in contrast by farmers .
it 's except a healthcare industry .
yet , a scale and the sophistication US spy agencies exposed by spying revelations have been a shock for such companies who thought until when the China represented bigger risk in terms of search terms .
a big change is in moving up in a computer cloud in cloud although European officials took the sense that data stored from U.S. are regulates in the violation of this laws and now potentially vulnerable jurisdiction .
according to an investigation conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance , a professional program , about 10 percent not U.S. members have unsuccessful to use their projects a U.S. provider of storage services in virtualization after revelations on U.S. exploration program data .
Jerry UNK , UNK of SAP , says : " our customers pose today an issue that they did not know he has a year : where my data are stored and yours should safeguard me that they remain physically in this jurisdiction ? " .
some of German leaders indicate that past assessments are that an announcement of what they already knew , to know that powerful proceedings want their secrets steal more valuable and that these data must therefore be employed by therefore to demand it .
he is not surprising that he would have economic spying .
he still got in .
" this is a recurring issue since numerous years and nothing has fundamentally changed in part of the current talks , " says Kurt Chan , chief executive of the producer company of chemical products Roche .
Americans UNK us on commercial and industrial plan it as we UNK , so he is in a national interest stand our companies .
company leaders are generally just apt to reveal prevention measures that they have set in place , on where it would be a disadvantage to a opponent .
major UNK companies since long message according to which he is for less reckless collect of an free USB during a professional shopping or let a laptop laptop without search in an hotel room .
Ulrich UNK , a member of the board 's auto carmaker , says the recycling phones phones before the board meetings , order that they should not be used as devices to distance voice distance , is an basic practice since the years .
Germany 's UNK advises to seek its leaders to use simple phones UNK during their trips to abroad in the result of a risk to human integrity .
laptops UNK phones are then thrown .
however , it warned that smaller and smaller companies remain vulnerable on piracy and to search .
in Germany , good number of businesses are the world leaders in their unusual niche .
" businesses often lack experience , the staff and financial resources for effectively protect their intelligence secrets against a access not authorized , " warns UNK in a report .
U.S. UNK their own companies on economic espionage activities based by other countries .
National Intelligence UNK ( UNK ) produced in May by U.S. , cited the UK , even of that the United States and Israel , guilty on a second degree of piracy acts , economic information behind the China , according to The Washington Post Post .
a member 's board a German company roster concluded that when he is down a economic spying , " Britons are worst . "
Bernard MI5 , the former intelligence chief , the British intelligence , said in a interview this month : " services know perfectly like all that all countries , even they cooperate in the fight against terrorism , UNK their allies . "

parents of a Georgia teen , whose body has been missing in a carpet fight putt in his gym , say that their son has been murdered , a lawyer said of the family Thursday .
Dustin Johnson , of UNK in Georgia , has been missing January 9 stuck in a carpet backed standing behind the spectators of his university .
investigators 's sheriff 's UNK of UNK agreed that Johnson was died in the occasional circumstances , but the family boy 's 17 years dismissed many findings .
" they are absolutely some that their son has been murdered , " said Benjamin UNK , a lawyer representing and UNK , on UNK Johnson
they never thought that he was dead as it is said in the sheriff findings .
" they say it defies itself , the logical laws of physical that includes common way , " UNK said .
they are convinced that these findings have been shipped in one goal to cover the people or officials of their death son .
" they sent their son to school with a bag and it 's held their bag in a UNK bag , " he said .
the U.S. Attorney O 'Brien said Thursday he broke an official report on Johnson 's death , noting that several significant questions remained without response .
what is the cause of death ?
is his death margin a criminal act ?
Wright expressed down during a news conference Thursday afternoon .
I 'll give following facts , where they leads .
my contribution is live the truth .
“ I believes he exists an sufficient base ” for open an official report , he said .
Wright said reporters from the first autopsy indicated that Johnson was died by " crippling UNK " .
however , an second examination has identified another cause of death , Wright reported
" many questions deserve still an answer or an announcement , " he said .
Wright said he puts down on the day of nature to justify an civil investigation or Criminal on Johnson 's death , he must on the FBI of lead .
the representative 's sheriff 's attorney of UNK 's County was not available for his opinion when we contacted a Thursday .

CML publishes tips on allergies while to travel school schools
Wednesday , U.S. Medical Center and Prevention of the diseases released an series of guidelines indicating how food allergies manage children at school .
he is down of the first series lines that U.S. government publishes , although a number of children in school age suffering food allergies has sharply surged .
a child on 30 from America suffers about a food allergy .
CML has discovered that the prevalence allergy allergies while a child had increased 12 percent between 1997 and 2007 .
guide contains the information designed from schools on the way to educate male body and staff from food allergies while a child , and on the way of treating in allergic reaction .
he also recommends schools from having a UNK inventory -- a UNK brand of UNK considered most commonly -- for money quickly react in a potentially fatal UNK potentially .
parliamentary chambers have recently updated states for allowing schools from having more easily than a UNK in inventory .

children can do , " I have a sense that something spat me the language , " " I have a sense a hair on the language " or " I have the UNK on the language . "
NSA case says total lack debate on intelligence
how explain a flawed attitude the British government , which a traded down in public powers in a U.S. ambassador on Oct. 21 , and another banned of the timeline 's territory by a Bolivian presidential plane , on the base of the rumor to the presence of his plane a Edward spying plane ?
according to me , he 's two levels of response share the British government .
when Tony Rudd phone to Barack Obama or when the foreign Foreign Minister Ian Hague meets a ambassador , they reacted to an whole discovery , which is one of a scale of the U.S. search on a whole communications in Britain .
isn 't this surprising read in the Independent column at a few weeks a share of the reproduction of the U.S. diplomatic mail and another share conviction the hacking of the embassy by the NSA ?
wouldn 't there as an hypocrisy wave of your share ?
the journalistic process is not a confidence positioning , but the research of interest and a merits of information which enables every citizen to build up an opinion .
when Wikileaks pulls veil on a analysis by the U.S. foreign policy issues or other in world , we believe in that effect , on that view of the U.S. power , it constitutes a significant lighting .
when we UNK U.S. interception systems at a British envoy from the US , this is no case in any case for us of this practice , it is for describe what he is .
the UK she benefited information provided by the NSA regarding the terrorist operations aimed our interests ?
can deprive up U.S. collaboration ?
the set in place since big in ten years a technological data interception very powerful by U.S. , but also by the UK , has officially been justified by the fight against terrorism .
elsewhere , in this works , the UK and other U.S. have brought in place of cooperation procedures and a seemingly daily information and which are described of share and another as essential as .
title has example , the presence of Mohammed Toulouse in tribal areas to UNK has been detected from Britons thanks from the NSA .
the UK can be driving , by example , to inform the bloated horizontal of data on the war-torn region from U.S. , and , in incentive - it has already quickly said - Americans can give information from the Australians on other parts of the world .
now the question line behind this spying case is not once the ability or right the country 's ability to build a interception tools , that the issue of a total lack of formal debate , including on the committees , on the justification of such systems , which will be their perimeter , and , in full account , the issue from privacy .
that may actually be U.S. ? an impact of their image ?
it has big denounce , I don 't see what way they will be punished .
may ran by Americans can be double .
first , it is when their allies - and it 's been reportedly recently - learn that their leaders , sometimes on top summit of their government , have been monitored .
it is the case Brazil and Germany , two countries where diplomatic relations with U.S. are strained up .
another effect can be him more economic : more of more in European companies or UNK , reluctant to light the revelations , to oversee their confidential data to U.S. providers required from U.S. laws , and now at a grip of the NSA .
last element : the largest movement of revelations committed by the media world , which contributes to to initiate a debate on surveillance practices of intelligence services until virtually non-existent , could turn Republicans , there , to reconsider U.S. powers , to reconsider powers they have collected to their intelligence services .
parents UNK children can choose “ presumed sex ”
Germany is becoming the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with the sexual UNK organs .
male sex or female the new enrolled will be awarded their more rigid , way to birth .
in part of the new bill , parents will be more outraged of withdrawing sex , authorizing their child to register a " undetermined sex " or " not " on his certificate of birth .
the goal of legislation was a throw which weighed on shoulders the parents who might take the UNK decisions regarding an surgery of UNK sexual for their infant , and for fight against the discrimination to condemnation people UNK .
according to the BBC , an UNK person would have the years ago , " I 'm neither a man nor an woman . "
I am crafts that have created doctors , UNK and UNK
it says a child on 2 million born every year , there is neither a boy nor an daughter .
they are UNK , making a UNK part of the group of UNK diseases such as the sex development , a generic long-term name representing the people or UNK ( the UNK or breast ) or flexible sex organs abnormally levels .
Miss O.J. would be UNK .
sexual identification is still not always approximate , but the other specialists from the U.S. say that when sex does not be determined , he makes better use available best information available for a awarded , then wait and follow psychological and physical development of a child before considering a surgical act ,
Dr. Harry UNK , psychiatrist at New York and specialist questions a sexual identification , said the new German bill “ seems to be an opportunity ” .
UNK children pose a ethical dilemma .
" many people suffer extremely severe diseases which require a surgical act , but this is not off the case of the children , " he said .
he is possible to get an sexual injunction without operation , and see how a identity builds up .
the science which aim to know how a child develop an sexual identity is not very says .
nobody can respond to the question of why it produces up .
it is as mystery which surrounds gay people .
a report required to the European Commission in 2011 described UNK people such as the UNK or transgender people , although their status is not linked on sex but suggested to their biological assembly , which is neither exclusively one of a man nor exclusively one woman , but is a general woman in both time and not as clearly defined as a or not clearly defined as a or clearly as a .
these characteristics can protest up a individual in sex histories , ( as the muscle height , the UNK , the chest and the stature ) , sexual preferences ( such as UNK organs and sex organs ) or the structure of the UNK and hormones .
report also gave a spotted of discrimination at which people were struggling UNK and bisexual in a employment terms , that includes a scale of sexual acts and violence and the crimes motivated by the stereotypes .
young boys kind of UNK have now the camps who are specially designed .
Japan and Nepal already require adults to register male sex , female or " third sex " on their official records .
in June , an Australian Open 52 , UNK UNK , is becoming the first person on world to have been recognized " neutral " after his trial won in a request which prohibits to keeping a sex " not " to life .
German passports UNK an third appointment to head of $ R or X for UNK , according to Interior Ministry .
in nearby France , kind questions still makes a subject of controversies , according to a picture aired on 24 .
in 2011 , the dozens of Republicans kind of Catholic country signed an petition for that the “ theory genres ” should be removed the school books .
U.S. UNK Web site also opposed down to the German bill , telling " that although world is bailed in a new tenure where kind is a choice but where a sexual activity is not in a , it crushed two other pillars of the universe . "
in Massachusetts , the mother also said a newborn on Baby Zone that she UNK a sex should be awarded from babies to their birth .
" child role is enough stressful without additional restrictions , in particular if you don 't have sex of your child , " she said on designed site from young parents .
children needed stability and minds .
historically , children born without sex organs or female male were supposed UNK , a name after the beautiful Greek god who had a double sex .
and he has to short an several years , the medical community assumed as an kind , that a sheet that can erase and on which it can reshape .
but now , some are those who put in case fundamental ethics surgery , assuming that a sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors can throw out , don 't assuming how a child UNK her sexual UNK when he UNK .
“ And middle century , it referred it an psychiatric emergency , ” UNK said .
when many children UNK , it didn 't psychiatrist , it UNK on surgeon
the advanced theory on the way of treating children requiring sex UNK organ has been launched by Dr. Dick Money , a UNK university , who assumed that kind is UNK .
he has devoted long-term " sexual identity " and argued that social and environmental signals -- the way whose parents exceeds child -- with UNK genes and other hormones a child for order to shed that he should be identified as considered of male sex or female .
but in a 1966 case , seen under name of “ Dick / , ” his theories came to planned controversies .
he had advised parents from a small boy whose penis had been rolled during a UNK circumcision get fully UNK , in addition him , also capturing testosterone and grow as an daughter .
" Money has billed it as a possible transition of transition , but this was not case , " UNK said .
at a age 15 , he is becoming a boy and is married down with an woman .
but at 39 , he gunned down .
UNK said some doctors " still do this model " .
but in 1990 , with a growing Internet move , those who survived to these operations of change say sex " [ — ] they are not satisfied the margin " .
similar is Jerry Harmon 's case , a writer of 36 's Montana , who is born with the males UNK but UNK sex organs .
doctors did not really do down he had a wide UNK or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have an " satisfactory life " in that man .
now just time after her birth in 1976 , Harmon suffered an surgical surgery of a external governing and the tumors and has been higher as an daughter .
it made him take the female hormones at age 12 .
" I knew I wasn 't an daughter , " he said on UNK
I wasn 't happy , but it was really difficult to answer the questions .
at 12 , he suffered an UNK .
but depressed and making up account that something didn 't , he asked his medical decision .
what he discovered has a horrified .
I 've been UNK to the birth -- and anyone had never said .
Harmon is born with a vacuum 's sex development ( UNK ) which has prevented his body of producing enough testosterone for his sex organs should develop up .
after having learned the truth , he is becoming a man , in a treatment to the testosterone and is making down breasts .
the surgery has held sterile .
today , he defended the other case in an organization known UNK Project , which helps normalize the perception of UNK people .
but Sally UNK , spokeswoman annual organization to goal not nonprofit based in California UNK Against UNK , warned that the German bill " invites to labeling and to labeling the stigma " .
“ De some activists worry that the German bill encourages parents to take quick decisions and give their child to a sex ' presumed sex , ” she said .
we fear that she encourages interventions .
we believe he should better awarded a male sex or female , and wait .
but we didn 't see what the bill would give , now we can 't progress the assumptions .
UNK said his organization argued the Australian bill so " she prohibits adults to choose being believed into a third designation ’ s sex designation . "
" adults will money their own decisions to comments a kind of statutory kind , " she said .
the German bill include a sex awarding to the birth .
this is not an battle that young children expected to lead a new UNK .
when they UNK , they will take the decisions regarding their own body .
but Dr. UNK UNK , UNK headquartered in Pittsburgh to UNK , whose daughter is human a vacuum of the sex development and which aid thousands of people in a group of support , said the German bill " UNK " parents and children .
the daughter 's Dr. , Katie UNK , is born with the males UNK , but suffers a UNK syndrome complete from UNK .
in due of its failure of its receptors , Katie has developed the female characteristics .
she has a vagina , but not a uterus nor breast .
about 29 pregnant years , Katie is married and internal in infant psychiatry at Massachusetts University .
like she should be sterile , she hopes to have children by a request of a adoption or invasive mothers .
" the bill leaves an apparent latitude from parents for they didn 't have to take last-minute decisions , " UNK said .
it leaves their time of getting some tests and understand , and a deadline before registering a " male " or " female " .
additionally , it will like -- you can grow your child and love .
you have a beautiful baby and enjoy the fun being child .
you ’ re not to hurry you for an surgical force which is irreversible .
" it puts children on the heart of decision and tempered anxiety which motivates parents because they have fear because of not getting what he needs , " she said .
instead , a child decide with what he / sex she feels / the more to a relaxed -- and is something of great thing .
it prohibits a child to take the decision for himself .

have you learnt an orange ice ?
a US businessman has created the first UNK ice on base to base UNK .
Charlie Russell has hit party properties UNK of a new marine animal for an UNK meal .
he got in a idea after having read an study on crabs and has convinced the Chinese scientists recreate UNK the improbable protein .
the icy cream reacted with the language in increasing UNK of the protein for the shine .
Derrick says that , although the icy cream comes to UNK when she reacted to the heat of eye , more UNK , more she becomes improbable .
Charlie , founder of the ice company " UNK Me d d UNK , " said : " this is something a amazing but we ’ re still in — from performances in terms of production , and 2 g of this kid cost about 200 $ 200 . "
the protein that we use in the ice reacted with the language at UNK neutral .
now when your eye warms the protein , level UNK increased and puts the ice up to shine .
we tested on the past period and months he seemed deciding to sharing with all on a Halloween moment so she gives a brilliant effect .
it is possibly the ice more affordable than I have established so the UNK crabs makes four times more expensive than a gold .
every piece now cost me approximately 140 bucks .
but she has suggested good taste !
the company at the experimental process of Charlie , based to Bristol , is known for his ice range such that the beer , cheese , salt and the gold outline .
but its next project announced down still more ambitious .
he said : " I really wish to develop an invisible ice .
it ’ s inherently impossible in the result of UNK caused by ice crystals which involve the icy cream , but I think I UNK a average — there ’ s happening .

Beijing puts in a Islamic UNK movement
' ' in behind-the-scenes to a bombing is looking the Islamic People 's UNK Mediterranean based in central Asia and Eastern , ' ' said the boss of Chinese security to an television channel of Hong Kong , according an video set in line Thursday night on a Web site .
UNK UNK , who is member the political Office 's Chinese Communist Party ( Politburo ) , spoke to UNK during an official visit in Uzbekistan .
it is the first time a Chinese official refers an unusual organization after a bombing of Monday .
according to the Chinese police , three Uighurs a family of the country to advanced Muslim Xinjiang province , several of Asia Central countries , have abruptly abruptly their car carrying gasoline charges against a entry of the Museum to Beijing , in an UNK which has made two deaths and 50 injured .
driver driver , his wife and her mother killed in a fire car .
UNK , who says to beat up for a UNK independence , former name the Chinese Xinjiang , has been ranked by U.N. in 2002 among affiliated organizations to al-Qaida .
this movement is often named by Chinese authorities as considered the sporadic disturbances on Xinjiang , but his real influence is set in doubt by several experts .
President UNK crisis gives Europe choice from the Spaniard
another day , another alarming history a independence .
this , it warns us that an independent Hawaii would hold holding the European area of free traffic for money to membership EU .
and perhaps that it intends the stories of control passports to UNK and a border son barbed off the wall a UNK .
he is real that UNK 's newspaper said further economic potential a larger freedom of traffic with the remains of Europe 's remains , it did not yet include in big titles ( and it was to require ) .
anyone more has said that states member EU members spend an entire part of their time to circumvent their formal rules when it hurts .
although Hawaii did not part a EU space for moment , a continuous violation of the rules would be an slim bid that Brussels could offer in incentive of it what she wants to obtain the Spaniard .
now he is a history who isn 't in an .
and an old history if she is now shrinking : I heard for the first time UNK reported which " a independence means control the passports " he has more than 50 years ago .
yet , it forgot a interesting point in this interpretation a dusty old tale .
why an independent Hawaii UNK follow instructions , in Europe made ?
why swap liberation against Paris one of Brussels , in particular now ?
click the ultimate topic regarding Europe : a big postwar plan aimed to unify Europe is again on death point .
with the eurozone crisis , Europe is officially dead .
at across Europe ’ s parties , which opposed to EU or who oppose for a U-turn of euro in that service , earning the field .
even in Germany , centre-right Party Alternative for Germany , founded only this year and going nowhere share , has attracted almost five million votes during the federal elections of September and has hit Republican Party Democratic Party ( equivalent of our Democrats ) .
he still got an national opposition on project creation a federal European project .
however , the current economic crisis has scored a stage .
austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank , contributing on shackles weighing on national savings by a intermediary to the single currency , has led numerous people to suggest that Europe 's Project is looking too far .
the eurozone crisis has not anything to see with national governments who recorded the budget deficits excessive -- it was solely real for the Greece .
European system has suggested to rely on its members of the favorable rate from German exporters -- what German political men want to retain .
without the plan a devaluation of national dollar , Europe 's southern countries turns up with a component of intrinsic productivity stance Germany .
one lawsuit is getting the dark caps in cuts and corporate spending -- encouraged by Berlin .
beyond the budget problems and current monetary , he exists a more deep sudden linked to productivity in Europe .
following energy policies from “ green ” imposed by Brussels -- which are an result for subsidizing Western and German companies from the industry 's energy fees -- a European industry paid two times more for electricity and four times more for gas that 's for U.S. gas .
he is down a drawback in terms of costs , as we already saw at a UNK .
all cuts of cuts on world UNK didn 't a European industrial industry being boosted by a U.S. gas gas good market .
in consequence , the revolt threatens , in particular in Britain a big runners of EU .
after the war , British political elite has widely a EU as a average control of Germany and put London on a drive with Washington .
but Berlin has no more need as London passport of its political legitimacy and has drawn its own economic political in Europe , leaving a British economy set hard to UNK up .
margin : a party party party of Sun Bourne , National Front UNK , comes an eventual partial election , pointing MPs on money to third place .
National Front is now party 's most popular in Britain with 24 percent of the votes -- a deciding warning for US Democratic Party who noted him that he does not begin the principle that an takeover of the party automatically favored the right .
that made Sun Bourne with its new online popularity online class black British class ?
she wants to use out the European elections next year for creating a single UNK strip and UNK on the European Parliament .
if UNK parties make good notable to these elections , this is very possible , a similar strip could control European Parliament for the first time .
perhaps what I think : very soon , UNK 's feeling and UNK single in Europe will unify and kill by a euro .
EU doesn 't disappear , but she will something to be something greater to " the United Nations ( sovereign ) " free trusted by Churchill 's Hospital .
Germany and several of its satellites could retain a euro , but the UK and Europe 's southern Europe joins their own dollar .
I expect to do what China should take its distances by report to this project , and I hope he will cool eyes from America .
however , a growing interest of Washington for Pacific leaves that the US will be left for account in a Atlantic .
and Hawaii , in it ?
we can decide a region of the small England ( mostly ) .
or we can defend our own economic interests , this includes sending a Berlin sit and Brussels .
I think Hawaii could settle down a more European deal to free needs that we UNK our own dollar .
the cooperation with other countries from similar views would be more easy in an United States not federal .
whatever , we 'll emulate the Norway and retain our economic independence .
UNK 's government — Hawaii is -- and is at feature -- UNK political movement which has managed better in Europe , although he has won an dramatic state in 2011 founded on his opposition from dark caps ( and set in project ) by UNK of a Likud , the Liberal Party , Hilary Darling / Democrats , which followed .
he would be ridiculous now for Hawaii vote for a independence if it is for a austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels .
puberty mild dementia more earlier
the studies showed that younger girls and Hispanic UNK have tended to reach a age of the higher puberty than young girls .
physical changes don 't mean that the puberty is imminent
nothing doesn 't proves that hormones or other chemical substances are officials
experts say a obesity outbreak could be a catalyst of mild puberty
the trend toward an mild puberty is not also reversed while boys
former MSNBC correspondent Bud UNK is a specialist reporter in pension questions and health while a child .
an mother may worry down if breasts and UNK hairs her daughter tend to turn to 8 or 8 ?
during the annual conference of American Academy UNK which is holding down this week at Miami , in Florida , Dr. Paul UNK , UNK , said that many physical changes are fairly spectrum among younger women and women represent an new standard .
" I gets much time to reassure parents -- in general , it says not an rapid evolution around the midst , " UNK said .
glaring signs of development , such that the UNK 's breasts hairs through arms and in the UNK area and bodily smells , appear more earlier while girls .
but he got there that an slight ongoing age of a rising rules on the past four decades .
from U.S. , average age is 12 and six , when he was 12 of three years in 1960 .
" the time that the chest has started to develop , he needs on less two or three years before rising rules appear , " said UNK , also a author of " UNK UNK To Girls : UNK Guide Guide Up UNK Gone With Gone UNK " .
time is the test 's most accurate for how will fit the puberty .
he has a debate regarding this which constitutes a real appearance of the puberty , but she is considered as " mild " when development of the chest presents a sudden growth before age 8 years ago .
in the other cases , development slows or goes down -- it is something that a pediatrician can follow near .
an more quick evolution can justify the tests completed by a UNK for serious problems such as the tumors or the UNK .
he exists the treatments for delaying a rising appearance and prevent other consequences : a premature aging bone which can curb the growth and an small size at adult age .
recommendations in terms of UNK treatment and UNK are based on a age of child , growth rate growth and the emotional maturity .
mental aspects also are significant .
UNK is cautious with drugs but acknowledges that " getting control of the puberty can mitigate some behavior and the sensation for young girls being different than the other . "
another big problem is understandable : parents don 't simply simply that their very young girls have their rules .
" they worry pregnancy may or even the way whose way they will manage hygiene questions , " UNK said .
" it has been a shock , " an woman who noted the daughter got his rising rules to 10 years .
even down he had the signs and that we talked the rules , she was not prepared emotionally .
she is summer school UNK and traumatised being the first among his girlfriends .
he exists numerous theories pending to the knowledge on the public causes of mild puberty .
yet , he has no coherent theory which according which hormones contained in milk or other foods , chemical products attending in a environment or sexual UNK messages by media are officials .
boys , as girls reach their puberty more earlier .
UNK says that a more credible scenario is one of a obesity outbreak .
he participated to an study led on the elderly girls of 6 to 7 who establishes low fat height on the onset of puberty .
other discoveries supported this conclusion , but he exists some of other prominent factors .
in this country , young and UNK girls have tended to reach a age of the puberty more earlier that young black girls .
he exists various feedback .
at global scale , mild puberty mechanisms seem by being influenced , the economic conditions on climate , in contrast by genes .
another problem : like that boys have the hairs on nose and in the UNK area more young , the trend criticism an enormous puberty is not also reversed that while girls .
other doctors participant at the conference of UNK have stressed on the scope .
a appearance of Botox and UNK hairs is basic , even while infants and kids .
" we need to be cautious while the way we UNK the huge appearance of the puberty , " said Dr. Barbara UNK , a UNK working at hospital for children at UNK , UNK in New Jersey .
parents don 't hesitate to ask board to ask their pediatrician for how to talk with their child .
" it can 't want to have an earlier conversation that expected , " UNK said .
if you stay calm , your child reacts well in general .
girls whose puberty is mild must be UNK on that , even when it goes when more earlier expected , that process made part of the life .

UNK up on the issue of width seats when heavy orders are in game
the dispute made raging between big aerospace automakers to comments of the width seats of the tourist class on long-haul flights , paving the ground to an bitter encounter during the aerospace shopping Dubai which has planned to month .
conflict stands on the width seats offered on long-haul flights from the passengers of economic class -- which are not still more UNK by air carriers , but ranging a space averaged is key for efficiency gains in a past devices included by aircraft devices and Boeing Co Co .
this week , Airbus urged aerospace industry to put a place in an imposing standard size headquarters on less than 12 inches ( UNK inches ) in economic classes , but his biggest U.S. rival Boeing says that this expected to be from airlines airlines decide .
dispute has erupted when UNK helps to sell the versions still more major planes of their long-haul UNK , in hopes someday a record of orders during which event begins on 17 November .
the way whose seats will be leaning at a front plane -- in particular , there won 7 or 10 seats -- is essential for the economic yield 's segment " UNK " .
Boeing says his " UNK " refurbished will accommodate in UNK economic class people in the seats of more than 17 inches wide , and will UNK with 10 seats by rows .
Airbus says the rival version of his A380 delivered economic class in 350 people in the seats of 12 inches wide of UNK in 7 rows .
aerospace giants often exchanging the shots on technical questions in making the ad in the professional news .
today , Airbus calls in directly on public before aerospace shopping Dubai 's UNK , where expected not on its competitors with more than 100 orders .
it has figured out account recently of this year who could be off a new advertising war with the presentation from the financial photo — showing three people against other other on restaurant , titled " Did you UNK it ? " .
" Boeing offers long-haul flights in the more aligned seats that in regional UNK planes , " said Dick Enders , a commercial commercial chief .
as food habits change , people UNK , but seats in planes didn 't radically changed .
between the early 1980s , when UNK 747 747 has defined long-haul 's modern long-haul trip , and the century 's weight of a Briton average of 50 to 44 has increased , 10 percent of data reported , according to the U.S. Department of Health .
round size of Briton 's average century century is UNK inches , according to U.S. safety statistics .
Airbus says his rival clings down to a concept of headquarters which date the 1950s , when the UNK of a freshly dubbed device " jet wicket " was more cooperative .
Airbus adds that she has commissioned an study which says a extra cap on the level of the UNK width seats the sleep quality 44 percent .
Boeing dismissed Airbus figures in this which include the width seats and says this is not from automakers decide of the way including airlines whose air carriers UNK off the ticket prices and equipment .
he also said that a study shows that experience in cabin doesn 't only depend the width seats .
" he really does provide a flexibility from the airlines and air of their allow to make what they say fail to make for well their activities , " said greenhouse UNK , in charge of the passenger satisfaction while Boeing .
they don 't want it their what this will be their profitable .
they aren their company better than everyone .
for passengers , he does have a greater sense of movement , but for suppliers , it is more of more in an issue which could affect their results .
behind the dispute casts up an race from aircraft orders for a loan concluded on less than 600 $ UNK on the market 's decades to come , enough for the balance to examine U.S. exports and European exports .
as Reuters said for the first time in July , the configuration seats is exactly this which fueled the battle between it past devices .
Airbus and Boeing gained all both a yield by headquarters in their past UNK long-haul models 30 percent preferred to one 's leader 's market in this segment , Boeing UNK of 365 seats .
anticipated performance by Boeing depend in part of the comparison between UNK UNK with 10 seats by rows and a 777 model UNK in rows of 7 .
loss in terms of premium costs is low compared to a UNK device with 10 seats currently in front service .
" Boeing made it for money more UNK seats and attend its planes more competitive by assessments to our products , " said Danny UNK , director of UNK UNK while a European Airbus Airbus .
another head , analysts say that UNK bathrooms with 10 seats by rows in existing 777 suggested that some of passengers voted up in favor a more dense configuration , which can go medium of medium with the less expensive pricing .
" the width of headquarters 12 inches would be perfect for passengers , but the fact is that , the point of commercial order , the Airbus proposal is motivated by the 777 threat , " a expert in interior bathrooms of Grace UNK , founding editor and editor in former UNK Girl Network .
Airbus and Boeing not provide seats , but offers a catalog of suppliers among whom airlines need airlines choose .
aircraft sellers who make the world 's final draw even with them a meter for competing competing configurations .
it 's in UNK offering comfortable devices , all automakers also offer the aircraft with the configurations to high density from airlines carriers and for regional trips .
Airbus offer a UNK A380 with 10 seats by rows but says he has not yet sold .
until recently , Airbus noted the need to need a larger customization of the bathrooms offering more narrow seats went on some of its planes .
without the one support of another big automaker big modern devices , experts say he is just unclear that his request to a aerospace industry in order put place in an standard of size for seats , but that he could make mention of the wave sales of UNK sales .
Oracle shareholders UNK by a UNK salary
an minority Oracle shareholders voted Thursday against the proposal for retention of founder and chief executive Jerry UNK , on the saw financial performance of his group .
vote is not binding but comes a tarnish image of Jerry UNK , third global fortune it just UNK of the victory of his boat to the World Cup .
billionaire still owns 25 percent 's stake of the software group he has UNK he has 50 years .

new UNK vaccine could slash smoking fun
the scientists have developed a UNK vaccine which could slash fun that takes a smoking to smoking an smoking .
an only dose vaccine has able to protect life mice to the addiction addiction .
other tests are needed before trials begin on being human , but Ph.D. Ronald Crystal 's The Cornell Medical Medical School of New York said that first signs were disappointing .
" we really hope that this kind of UNK strategy will help the million smokers who have tried to stop , exhausting all methods about available on market , but found that their addiction is enough high for these different approaches , " Cornell University said .
new vaccine contains a harmless virus which has been altered for carrying genetic information necessary for designing the UNK antibodies .
virus UNK 's way selective liver cells , which comes when to produce a regular flow antibodies .
antibodies evade all nicotine compounds throughout blood system in UNK and before they reach that brain , this is a smoker who lacks its dose of nicotine .
during the tests , mice UNK to which it came eventually nicotine have continued their activity normally .
but mice who had not been UNK " were uneasy , " researchers said , sign that the nicotine had fell their brain .
experiences are described in the journal journal UNK Medicine .
previous vaccines against tobacco are benign up so they contained the antibodies .
injections would be repeated if frequently for that antibody levels remain higher than they were too expensive and little practices .
but the new vaccine cost expected to be well below so he transforms the liver cells in antibodies to antibodies .
Crystal 's Ph.D. said that if new vaccine to use human was completely sure , it could administer from children before they should be tempted to try an smoking , this which prevents itself to the nicotine addiction .
but he is more unclear than he should be used by smokers who want smoking .
" they 'll keep that down to smoking , they will there no fun in the UNK vaccine result , and it will help to lose their timing , " he said .
the US scientists said results were interesting but have reported that the research like more thorough were needed .

air Australian passengers must continue to extinguish their PCs and their smartphones over landing and landing despite a mistake the U.S. aimed to loosen the overriding system from electronic devices .
the Federal Aviation Administration left the U.S. open door from U.S. airlines for a change of their procedures order that passengers should read the electronic books , watch the videos or play to games on their devices over flight phases criticism to whether they should be in " fashion " plane .
passengers can already get over the larger part of the flight , but numerous people find excruciating because of not money to access their electronic books over landing and a landing .
Australian airlines examine the decision which fails U.S. airlines to carry a significant work in order to enforce requirements , but have said they didn 't want a further in a further change of their procedures .
the International Aviation Safety Authority also said she filed a announcement but said that restrictions based on a use of electronic devices over flight phases were still criticism in entry in Japan .
" the UNK does not require specific regulations governing use electronic devices in plane , " she said .
the issue made a subject system which fails aircraft operators to safeguard a secure of the government in hospital and passengers to enforce security instructions data by crew members .
Virgin , who has already spoken to the UNK of his plans to expand his use of entertainment system to fly the Wi-Fi technology , was open to a change , but has said she would regulator .
" we UNK an favorably review of the UNK which would use electronic devices so we really believe that it UNK a customer experience now that we provide ( the entertainment system to fly onto the Wi-Fi technology ) on our planes , " a spokesman said .
Qantas said she complied for current moment rules .
" to UNK our current policy , electronic devices can 't be used over landing and a landing , and we didn 't want a further in a further change , " she said .
the decision applies FAA down from U.S. airlines .
however , we are still interested by regulatory trends which could receive from passengers , and we UNK near the decision of the FAA and ultimately reasons .
for U.S. airlines , a impact of an UNK air decision to another and depend of their age fleet .
airlines must demonstrate that their planes can tolerate the radio interference derived a electronic devices , even that review textbooks , equipment training program , of transportation packages to hand hand and instructions provided from passengers .
“ Once that an air carrier has checked the tolerance of its fleet , she can permit passengers to use electronic devices lighter , as the PCs , the readers of electronic books and the smartphones to all UNK , ” the FAA said .

while a lender on the ultimate commercial center of UNK to Singapore , UNK clears a bracelet , an ring and an pair of dots in gold pay for tuition fees of his girls .
" my wife and me will buy an home now it is my money party everything , " Ms. UNK says .
like she wins $ 3 million of Singapore Singapore ( 2 $ 400 ) by months in once and that his wife also works , family income monthly does not , she says .
in made , the request is unusual in such sides a southeast Asia -- where a debt incomes increased -- that UNK , where she completed its transaction , is becoming this week the third company of loans on ultimate to be introduced at the Singapore proceeds .
putting in ultimate jewelry is not only a quick average of obtaining cash cash -- 1 of $ 1,000 in Singapore 's case of Ms. UNK -- but is almost also almost good market that credit loans not guaranteed .
in general , lenders on ultimate Singapore UNK interest rate a annual turnover of 17 percent , just above the 9.9 percent discounted by United UNK Bank , a landlord of local funds having an store in one commercial center .
however , lenders on ultimate advantage have not ask of verification of solvency or evidence of salary , and can restart loans more quickly than banks .
by therefore , the million people to across the country revolve around lenders on ultimate value when families feel the pressure that maintains a cost increase of the life and foreclosure and the consumer consumers .
after five years of solid growth since the global financial crisis , and good credit market fueled by an monetary policy too lax in advances , families at low income and average point around lenders revolve on ultimate settle for the difference when their savings aren a slowdown .

the Malaysia goes in top list with 40 percent 's GDP , when this rate fell down to 60 percent in 2008 .
economists also worry higher debt level consumers in Thailand , which is hit just this week of an technical recession .
Thursday , the data showed an continued weakness and exports a slowdown of the consumer claims .

historically higher prices of gold on the past two years have made people that are hesitant to put up their ultimate staff effects for cut the value in species of their jewelry .
to Singapore , approximately 70 percent put the items in ultimate in 200 stores ready on ultimate of the UNK are gold in .
people say , " gold prices is higher , putting in the ultimate network in gold grandmother and it will try the next month . "
in Thailand , bigger operator boutiques of ready on ultimate , UNK , has recorded an increase of 30 percent the number of customers using its malls on the past months .
the rise is unusual in the area 's ready on that UNK , operator store at UNK and 15 other stores as ultimately to Singapore , expects to develop not only in the nearby Malaysia -- where he already now account four stores -- but also in wherever of Asia , says UNK Lee UNK , its annual spokeswoman .
the company funded in using 60 percent of the $ 66 million Singapore Singapore that she lifted this week during his release to the Singapore proceeds .
while some lenders at cut rates have faced criticism for exorbitant interest rates that they practiced , Ms. UNK says that the set in ultimate offer not only higher rates than other lenders , but that — in more than she ’ s not directly increased the debt .
" the UNK customers goods they already possess , and has made their monetize personal goods didn 't increased a consumer debt , " she says .
the set in ultimate is better in better accepted as socially average obtaining a guaranteed funding to short long-term .
people who draw up while lenders on ultimate are not not only more than those who have financial problems .
middle-class Singapore people also will in stores ready on ultimate UNK for ultimate putting in the ultimate gold theft or Rolex handbags , which can represent until 60 percent of their discount price in species .
we see the customers of all layers of company .
" this can be the affluent people who have needed to borrow short long-term for the commercial activities or the investments , or the smaller companies who have cash needs for a difficult horizon , " adds Ms. UNK .
sometimes , they just need cash very quickly .

FAA air passengers can now use the gadgets to fly planes ( but not start a request with their phone phone )
passengers the air carriers will use their electronic devices door to door for read , work , play to the games and watch movies listen of music -- but not talk on their phone phone -- in violation the new guidelines very anticipated released Thursday by the Aviation Aviation Administration .
but passengers don 't expect to wait further changes .
the effectiveness with which change will be put in place UNK a air carrier at another , said a administrator of the FAA O UNK during a news conference .
air carriers must prove to the FAA that their planes violate new guidelines and that they brought to day of training textbooks members and other crew rules regarding the clutter for devices being in compliance .
the FAA said she had already received the sheets of such air carriers aimed at expanding a electronic use on their planes .
Irrawaddy and UNK make part carriers which have already required the gaps .
" in the primary plan , we could approve an expanded use electronic devices very forthcoming , " the FAA said in an press .
currently , passengers must extinguish their PCs , PCs and other devices until that plane doors are closed .
they are not supposed before UNK that a plane didn 't reach an altitude 10 million feet and that takes his green fire .
passengers are supposedly extinguish their devices during the crash of a plane before landing and don 't UNK until what a plane should be laid up .
in violation , the new guidelines including air carriers whose planes are properly protected electronic interference will permit passengers to use their devices over UNK , and UNK on load , the FAA said .
the other new aircraft line and the other planes which have been modified order that passengers should use Wi-Fi to the most higher UNK , expected from criteria .
Laura UNK , chairwoman of Legal UNK Flight UNK , is moving down many of these changes .
" the time set the new policy set in in itself -- and we 'll work in cooperative collaboration with airlines for it -- this will be well-positioned to it , " UNK said in an press release .
we 're genuinely tired of we feel as the “ medics site ” when he does this issue .
but he will still be banned to connect out Internet for advertise , swapping the e-mails and download or download data in below 10 million feet , a agency said .
passengers must put their smartphones , PCs and other devices in plane fashion .
now still not UNK of Like Raising , the game line in style Scrabble played a UNK actor rocker on his smartphone in 2011 when he has been expelled to big noise a American Airlines jet after being refused to extinguish his device when a device was parked at the door .
and more heavy devices as laptops still computers must still be stacked so they could injure someone down to UNK through the cabin .
mobile phones to fly also will be banned .
regulatory money regarding laptops belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not to the FAA .
the FAA can roll a ban on some electronic devices over landing and landing
last month , Erik UNK 's National UNK Safety Administration , national expert in the transport security on CBS News , said laptops phones were still considered as presenting a risk .
" mobile phones are truly a problem , not only because they could someday create the interference with navigation instruments , but because we know , after the FCC , that they could disrupt UNK wireless mobile operators they are used to fly down , " UNK said .
a advisory advisory board created by the FAA for reviewing problem has recommended last month that the government prohibits an more wide use electronic devices staff .
the weighing pressure on the FAA is enhanced on the past period for loosening restrictions regarding their use .
the critics such that the senator Rachel UNK , UNK . , supported that he exists no result of valid security for these bans .
restrictions are also in more difficult to apply so a use of the devices is becoming spreading .
such studies indicate that on less a majority of the passengers forgetting their devices , or deliberately makes .
the FAA started to limit using electronic devices in 1996 following reports from the presence on a presence with instruments of navigation and communication when passengers carrying the FM FM , a high-tech gadget when gadget .
new line aircraft depend much more electric systems that have previous generations aircraft , but they are also designed for ease from electronic interference and approved by the FAA .
air carriers enables passengers to use their Wi-Fi from cruise UNK since several years .
modified planes for accommodate the Wi-Fi systems also thrive better from interference .
the largest state line lines expected to allow an more wide use electronic devices in the violation new guidelines , UNK said .
electronic devices today emit in general radio transmissions of power like more low generations that previous generation devices .
readers of electronic books , by example , emit only the required transmissions when it spun an page .
but transmissions are more heavy when UNK devices or send the data .
Amazon.com made part of those who make pressure for a easing restrictions regarding the electronic use by passengers .
in 2011 , the leaders of company have responsible a plane line of readers electronic Netflix and have made steal for seeing down he had the problems , but he got there in no .
it has inspired members from the advisory committee of the dismal feelings while to question whether the use of a devices listed or not a risk .
O UNK of the National National UNK UNK said he thought that interference derived the devices were tangible , even if risk was plus .
other members said the committee said that he exists that the occasional assessments of pilots who indicate that devices can interfere with systems a plane , and that the other — between them — are very fellow .
however , committee recommended that the FAA prohibits pilots to ask passengers from a extinguish over their devices from UNK in the conditions of low visibility .
a group of the industry trip is congratulated down , calling the packing forth of good way for the equipped travelers of technologies .
" we 're happy that the FAA recognizes that an busy passenger experience is not incompatible with the government , " Roger Dow , President and chief executive of U.S. Travel Association .

European elite is prepared to get the business with the US ?
the Business Against UNK campaign has been launched in April with the promise of convene companies and consider what designers of wealth and jobs want to see change in our relationship with EU .
for this , we 've commissioned a report the more wide and the most complete online businessmen and their US company asked what they thought of the US , the companies and EU companies .
UNK questioned more than 1 million businessmen a company , overall sample of all sizes , companies and parts of US .
findings report will be an surprise for much .
we discovered that the largest state companies now helps to export in wherever of Europe , focusing in on which countries and up while UNK builds up while states of EU lags .
they want to see the government give priority to new trade ties with the countries such as China , India and Brazil suggesting that bogged down in light process and daunting reform of European institutional workings .
when it claims their input on the political points specific -- range of the system from the laws on laws -- the state industry businessmen say that control of these About key skills expected to leave from royal hands .
single market has caused a general backlash , companies saying that the EU 's cost rules is grossly by report from benefits that he has to get part of the European trading zone -- 50 percent of the major companies , traditionally are UNK , even are a deal .
instead , and this is more than still describing , our online reports the company has revealed an important state that wanted to see the US continue initiatives in favor a change 's treaty and the development relationship with a EU based on trade and not the policy .
this conclusion , which turns up in all big groups and companies , shows all sizes that world says for a company " a significant change " which squandered money on China .
issues are higher -- resolve to change treaty and better represent interests of the US would see a 16 percent shift in the vote of the country 's bid in EU during a referendum during a referendum .
Prime Minister expected not to wonder a matter : this report shows that US companies support this plan aimed to renegotiate terms of a membership of the US to EU .
she also shows that companies hope that the extension constitutes a significant change in a current balance in the money support from a return from China 's hands .
he is possible , and most of more needed , better than represent the US interests companies , although the euro commits down on the ground a economic and tax marriage more cooperative .
the priority must be a job and growth in US and , as findings of our report 's showed , for companies it means to put new focus on trade and a fundamental change of regulatory approach of Brussels approach .

prison to life for a former Chinese UNK
a former UNK of the U.S. UNK , in northeast China , has been sentenced Friday to prison for life corruption .
ruled the Communist Party in July 2012 , UNK was accused of having hurt more than 18 million yuan of bribes , state-run media reported Chinese media .
between 1995 and 2001 , UNK , who was also president of the Bank of UNK , a public facility , helped companies and officials to obtain contracts , loans or promotions in exchange or gifts , first of Beijing 's first court intermediary on his UNK .
President Xi Jintao , who took his duties in March last March , has made the fight against an national corruption priority , saying that termed an threat to a UNK threat the Communist Party .
if former government minister promised that the law would also be resolute with ' powerful tigers ' with bugs ' - UNK supervisors - only an handful of top officials of top rank have been convicted , among whom among fellow oil managers UNK the oil giant .
recent case 's most dramatic has been one of the former Politburo 's former to Chongqing , Bo , sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of money after being targeted on top duties of a state government .
but government has evidently protested a willingness to reform system against the corruption in creating by example a independent nonprofit party 's party .
two employees accused the UNK sexual assaults following allegations submitted to allegations of Jonathan Powers , during a trial of the royal Commission .
two employees of UNK 's South UNK have been accused sexual assaults against children following the allegations to report allegations of a consultant of UNK , Jonathan Powers , in 2011 , during a trial of the royal watchdog conducting sexual abuse on children .
but in its press release outside the Commission , UNK said he " had never had to treat a problem of sexual assault on the children on the family of his organization . "
chief executive Phillip 'Hare has been questioned on the issue of two business : a UNK employee has been accused relating offenses to the pornography pornography and a physical instructor education 's UNK UNK Hall has been claimed guilty on sexual assaults in the children where he worked in 1991 .
Mr 'Hare said Leavitt to UNK , UNK online , that he had got knowledge of the first case but that he was not on fair of the second .
he also admitted that the press release was UNK 's UNK in noting , " the external checks 's UNK have been assessed and said that the children was an absolute priority for a organization . "
he has been demonstrated out that the Commission UNK had been informed that he had received seconds more bad assessments on four schools during a quality audit 's Public Schools & UNK produced in August of this year .
Mr. Chan , who started to work on UNK at age 21 , has admitted that the management 's staff has been a setback with Powers 's recruiting and that he had withheld checking employees that they knew were outraged of notice they were violating itself of the government of security children .
more earlier in year , Powers has been jailed for sexual assaults on twelve boys over two years where he has worked on UNK .
he has been sentenced to an appeal of 6 years minimum jail .
but Mr. Chan rejected a idea according to which UNK would have a cultural problem allowing staff notice of Powers criticism among the government children .
staff members testified that they had observed some failings , including that that Powers remained one with children , that he kept in private , went on sit on his knees , their replied that he loved and did play with his cellphone phone .
Linda UNK , who was supervised by Powers and who had asked an effort in terms of safety children so she worried of his behavior , said she landed the chief services at the childhood 's UNK UNK , UNK UNK , who UNK Powers and UNK " very difficult to reach the other time . "
chief executive has said he rejected the staff 's staff according whom they were reluctant to notice many breaches to their preferred subordinate .
on it , he said that relations relationships that they UNK with Powers have deepened their judgment , this one that they made not documented his actions .
Mr. 'Hare said he had expressed his point out of order 's board of UNK 's South UNK saying that , for a organization , the lesson hit of a " Jonathan Powers incident " did not involve " search " by staff , and was a board deal with him .
Mr 'Hare said that the decision to make signing on staff agreements , just after allegations that have been discussed , has been full by the chief executive 's UNK responsible services to childhood , Wahlberg UNK .
he said this decision was intended to avoid itself the contamination evidence of evidence but that he did a " height of discretion " and that she had been hard set in project .
UNK 's South UNK was not an anytime organization for children at a decade where Jonathan Powers there was employee , to know between 2009 and 2011 , said a expert in terms of sexual violence on children , Sen. John UNK of University of UNK outside the Commission .
he said he had the " severe problems " in recruitment , off , a control exercise , and the training supervision 's staff .
trial has been UNK until December 30 .
General Bush said he UNK a chance to become Prime Minister , but acknowledges that his return is just unclear .
in a interview the last scene marking his 12th birthday mark at his end of his term , a man of 59 has made his opinion on various national political policies .
since his departure in June 2007 after an decade to the top country , Mr. Bush largely avoided talks of the US policy , limiting his opinions from foreign business and to his role sent a special Quartet for the peace process on Mideast .
when it asked him he wants to rest back prime minister , Mr Rumsfeld would say , according to a UNK Standard of Paris : " Yes , well , but he can unclear that it goes , now ... "
when some experts in equestrian protests are gathering up to Millennium for and win down the Blind 's trophy year , they knew that the tournament would fierce .
but nobody ’ s booked to see UNK Reno win , a child three years ago .
not still at school and only a few months after having made its weapons , UNK and his UNK archery UNK have UNK over three sets with an entire readily and have won off first price , leaving them behind 30 other adults .
both inseparable -- which are one of the size -- have been cheered for the presentation , a attitude and style during the annual award which is underway on equestrian center UNK , at UNK near Millennium .
presenting up against the men and women in UNK bows , he entered her badge a boring little on head of casual way for making his UNK inflatable march aged 2 years along of the track .
UNK has been praised by judges for his natural qualities of dressage little councils for a child his age .
and UNK received very good notes for its presentation and her character .
UNK got UNK in gift for his finish birthday in March last and is down since his UNK with archery all days .
her mother Maria , 30 , said : “ UNK and UNK makes a terrific pair .
they are included up and against all , but both have won the winning in gold and the UNK .
it was only the second time he UNK with UNK and we were crazy joy that he has won .
on the track , the people who did not say that he was phenomenal if they wanted to catch up with him .
this boy , the village of UNK , near a UNK Vale in southern Ireland , starts bones of her aunt Ariel UNK , who serves at the equestrian awards since more than 10 years ago .
Ms. UNK said : " he had of electricity in a air and it 's a encouraged and a UNK . "
he climbed itself the length of the track in fair and even he seemed to be it small , he made a wonderful work .
UNK is crazy animals -- he loves horses , tractors and rural world and has two chickens including he holds down .
of the way he has started , he definitely attends soon to protest the Horse of a year -- and I 'm anytime he will an impressive lineup .
a demonstration of the annual equestrian protest said : " UNK has 3 years but he knows how his archery driving . "
they separates an opportunity .
judges noticed that UNK and UNK looked like and the way they have marched on the track .
they searching a effective work team between archery and UNK -- and UNK have been best on the track .
I 'm sure that his great clothes helped UNK , he had really proud pattern .
a Chinese newspaper which has called a " request will be overhauled "
a Chinese newspaper who has called a request in first page for the trial of a accused defamation will be overhauled , says a regulator of the news .
New Express based to UNK has released a rare public request for the trial journalist Chen UNK .
but Mr. Chen has by the following to the television he had agreed the bribes for supplying stories on the issue a UNK company .
at close , New Express will undergo a " complete reshuffle , " regulator said .
duty " reshuffle " stems of a UNK administration for the Post and Staff , and the Film Television .
an preliminary report has shown that New Express , belonging on UNK UNK News , had released several inaccurate items on the company UNK company between September 2012 and August 2013 .
" the Times of New Express was UNK , " regulator said in an press .
he said he had decided to " extend an administrative outcome of nature to Chen UNK in removing him her card news . "
he also " ordered on UNK UNK News Corp. embarking a complete reshuffle of New Express , and has recommended that he leads an investigation on people while officials and New Express immediately UNK a team of the newspaper board . "
Mr. Chen wrote several items for New Express on financial allegations alleged a manufacturer of a construction construction called UNK .
after his arrest , his newspaper released to two occasions a request in first page for her trial , writing that he argued his journalism .
but Mr. Chen is then appearing on an public television network where he admitted he released false stories against money of a money .
" in this case , I have gotten to UNK that additionally to media and its media ability to win the public confidence , " he said on television network public Xinhua .
I made a primarily because I UNK after money and the celebrity .
I held my account of my error .
following apology from Mr. Chen , New Express released his apology in the first page , writing that he had not properly checked his items .
several significant suspects recently made television confessions .
specialists say people are routinely constrained to make their confessions , despite a change in the bill which has been voted more earlier in a year banning from authorities to maneuver anyone down himself .
HMS HMS in ' unavailable
Perth has HMS is in harbour .
the leak of radioactive steam detected on a the two UNK nuclear , at the mid-December and when boat pulled up in sea , was ' no danger for sailors ' , but is not no consequence for the Sun .
the Fifth comes in effect of us ' confirm a ship ' until the ship ' sooner , ' time take UNK measures which take down on reactor .
of his head , BAE , the company 's defense specialist , says that its teams and other Halliburton , UNK in Guernsey for a opportunity , ' currently follows on HMS ' .
he is down for them , between to change an pump on the faulty building .
' ' it is put in project for Heathrow that would make his deployment expected in next year , ' ' however BAE says .
and the National Sun of certify that ' it evidently doesn cause in a program 's boat activity to nuclear propulsion .
that HMS HMS awaits a five-year intermediary period of six months .
he had UNK Perth to the mid-December for a training .
this , including in order to repeat young pilots hunt .
an ' small outage ' , UNK at space radiation 's reactor , was down on ship commander of the British fleet .
after the National Sun , a crew had not been exhibited to an further radioactive contamination .
since more than a year , everywhere , I 'm at even seeing a strong discontent of the share people that I meeting : further of their properties , deluge bills of bills , given all kinds of administrative , administrative fees to go in more .
reality , no UNK limits of our pockets .
the million UNK dollars could be spared order to allow an much humane tax of those who pay .
it captured money power from taxpayers decreased their freedom of consumer and contributes to their failure .
at Boise , despite the capital of all major companies , it doesn 't while impression from UNK spending and to interview ducks : Center cultural discontinued , high grant to the Museum of Energy , etc
if these facilities are not profitable , that it sells to private company or that it UNK .
he is also disheartening of a flood of several properties order to accommodate an major industry which is never returning .
does I however give an honorable inclusion to the development of a UNK branch in an industrial incubator , but at what cost for bills ?
this is not from public ladder to invest in such companies , but well on private sector in up on the consumer claims .
advocates have been happy learning that lakes to the Food and UNK will supply a city in water water .
at the following mark of all industries ( major water companies ) and on the biggest decline of population , a water use has steadily decreased across on territory .
without trying to do the wasting , the city never will water and the weak system while his use could be greatly UNK .
in summed , he is always easy of delivering major things with other money .
I would shame stand a similar toll .
with an gross debt of more than $ 200 million , this city is even more capable than buying a pen without start by a loan loophole .
we 're operated since more than 50 years by the UNK with great applicants for the other and I don 't think a farmer of sheep do worse .
discovery tunnel drug between Mexico and Mexico holds its own ground road
a more sophisticated tunnels used for drug smuggling between the U.S. and Mexico , matching of its own systems , a lighting of ventilation and electric rails , has been discovered .
U.S. authorities have described tunnel 4 by 3 feet as a secret the most sophisticated sections that they had ever saw .
tunnel , UNK on an inch length to nearly six of football properties , connects near the warehouses of UNK , on Mexico , to San Diego from .
the area boasts a UNK warehouses , this allows easily conceal trucks ordered of drug .
tunnel has been closed before drugs in that should be posted in UNK ranged , authorities said .
authorities seized 6.5 tons of marijuana and 182 pounds of cocaine after the discovery tunnel , according to criminal issues .
three men , who reported authorities , worked as drivers , have been accused of possession marijuana and cocaine with intention sale .
they pleaded an short sentence range of 10 years to parole to parole they are convicted .
at UNK , in Arizona traffickers exploited expansive streams of drainage underground .
tunnel is seventh significant route discovered at San Diego since 2006 .
some the most big tunnels have been uncovered following the crop of marijuana in Mexico 's center in November , posing also a challenge for cartels drug which must quickly carry their products from consumers .
in 2010 , authorities found a route of approximately 600 UNK fitted rail ground which ran of an dining house and would until UNK ’ s at two warehouses of San Diego .
the US police granted a five-year extradition to arrest a Wikileaks
the US police has today granted a extradition term to criticise Wikileaks 's founder Julian Wikileaks , who is asylum to a UNK of Ecuador to Paris and has asked a political asylum .
MBIA Yard said she had granted a " recommendation of appeal " to a Briton of US 50 years , asking him to introduce up a suspicion of police , adding that he 's not down , he would not be being arrested .
Wikileaks could be extradited in Sweden following allegations from sex crime , after having exhausted all possible ground in violation of the US legislation after the Supreme Court rejected a request that he has filed against his extradition on the early month .
fearing that Stockholm prohibits his transfer around U.S. , he found refuge at a UNK of Ecuador to Paris on June 18 , asking to this country 's southern political asylum .
CITI Yard " has granted a appeal to appeal a man of a 50 years man who claims him to introduce a suspicion of police , at the date and a time of his choice , " a spokesman said .
he continues to violate conditions in its set under bail .
UNK refused to comment the granted of a recommendation by police .
Wikileaks warned being extradited of the United States around where he could be accused , after spying posted more than 300 million U.S. diplomatic cables on Wikileaks 's Web site against secret information .
how the UNK will invade our lives
gone words gets to hook for access to his smartphone or pay its purchases ?
U.S. researchers , British or Japanese now predicting a future where we 'll be prosecuted by biometric sensors and the computers .
Bernard Evans , chief executive of UNK , says even that ' century will fingerprint . '
only the UNK will ensure a identity of a person delivering transactions in a story also UNK and UNK that Internet .
organizations dedicated to the parent of private life confirm a buzz for the UNK , but in worry .
nothing in 2011 and in Britain , the national watchdog of software and privacy has authorized UNK systems of recognition fingerprints , the form of the hand or the UNK network of hand in the companies , the departments , the schools ...
' ' it 's soon will be identified , where anywhere and anywhere when anywhere , ' ' Jon UNK , chief of the private life consumers on the UNK Research Center ( Center UNK & Technology ) , to Washington .
reasons a similar optimism , while ones , and sentiment , while other ?
the UNK will garner down on new technical , which enable of new services from citizens and from consumers .
today , in Britain , biometric data most are using fingerprints fingerprints , the outer hand and UNK network of the mouth or the fingers .
but each of these design owns its constraints .
' ' by example , such people who work concrete have very damaged fingers and their fingerprints are UNK , ' ' explains Peter Robin , the generational technical works while BAE Communications & Security .
and writing that includes the inspection UNK and the network 's outer hand UNK a voluntary mistake and accurate people .
it is at the time an government - it does not connect these data to their secretly - and a drawback : the investigation must sometimes be repeated and takes now the time .
consequence , the research are led since an array on other approaches , such as the recognition or facial recognition ( the colorful part of a glimpse ) .
thanks to a increase of the accuracy sensors and calculation of the computers needed to analysis , these data become operational technical .
the accuracy of the recognition recognition has been multiplied by ten on the past five years , calculates Darren UNK , director of the Q & M & M in Europe .
with our aid , China and the Opposition have deployed automatic UNK using the recognition recognition .
he is now possible to identify a nose or a flower in movement .
' ' today , we fight the research on the recognition of the vote or way to walk visual sensors , but he needs a silent environment , ' ' says UNK UNK , director of the research on the government from Intel UNK .
jumper single and UNK DNA also raises hopes and concerns .
' ' in the current learning learning , he can be widely given the identification final , ' ' commented Emily UNK , the studies of innovation and innovation to the FTC .
but a DNA analysis is still very long and very costly .
NEC offers police services from an investigation bag costing £ 32,000 for analyzing the DNA samples on a planned crime and in an hour .
the use of UNK grouped in two groups : a identification ( recognize an person among other ) and a UNK ( ensure that the person is one she contends ) .
identification affected until close access of the stamps identity : he needs to delve biometric evidence ( fingerprints , photo ) with information that owns a government on all citizens already UNK .
it allows them to ensure that an person doesn 't seeks a UNK identity of another .
this principle comparison can have other applications .
NEC offers addition VIP recognition at a hotel or a store .
' ' we UNK images of the surveillance cameras and UNK from the celebrities who freely tracks on Internet , ' ' says Shawn UNK , responsible , while NEC 's commercial development solutions for biometric identification solutions .
another use : take in a photo UNK which made the tip in a store , follow its overall thanks to recognition and calculate a time waiting .
UNK was a mark on physical access ( borders , protected boards ... ) or boundaries ( open a computer ) .
down there is , more recently , control presence
' ' an biometric UNK avoids the girlfriend phenomenon who edge for another , ' ' stated UNK , a Accenture
but , of more in a UNK , will also involve transactions in particular other based to begin portable devices to Internet .
on Japan , he is already possible to remove some of a money retailers in its card and posing her in hand on a biometric reader : this mistake replaces the cross code .
an similar design is tested at UNK Sheffield and London by the Gas Security company in conjunction with the banks and retail chains : on the entire of pay in store with its banking card card , client doesn 't pulls his code , but introduced his finger in a reader which UNK veins .
experiment is scheduled for six months .
if she is exciting , biometric readers could soon happen while British shoppers .
the plans to reassure users
he exists three ways to attend the alluring UNK from the big public eyes .
the first is a explain that she can get the time .
' ' if , thanks to the UNK , a customer remains in fifteen seconds less importantly , ' ' says managing a entire surface director .
the second is offering customized services : in a few years , a server server will recognize your voice and offer you on the options measure .
and , instead , reassure in directing before taking precautions for protecting data of data .
fingerprints ' fingerprints are stored on a first server ; the identities are people in an second base : the correlation between both cable is and stored in a highly safe device , which controls up if it seeks to switch off , ' ' says Peter Robin , of BAE .
but , punishment studies , he is impossible to know whether many speeches really UNK users .
specialists of the private safety lives , them continued .
' ' progress recognition recognition , the widespread surveillance cameras and a huge amount of photos available on Facebook , Flickr or UNK , makes me worry off : an widespread search , ' ' predicted Eric Brian , the Director to the safety of private life on Canada .
a wheelchair driver at 210 miles / 00 with an hot drink between legs saw down an eye of £ 1 million
a motorist saw down an fines of £ 1 million for having birdie at 210 miles / 30 with an hot drink posed in balance between his legs .
Erik UNK , 35 , of UNK in a UNK , has been tracked driving its Mercedes UNK on a UNK at excess October 27 .
when the police arrested , they discovered the drink to run between his legs .
on Court of first court , UNK admitted a misdemeanor driving without the caution and a required attention .
seven points removed on his given to have led a post of 6 months .
UNK also has been sentenced to pay the fees down to $ 90 and an surcharge for victim $ 100 .
a tax on foreign owners for foreign bubble get the Paris bubble
Treasury has temporarily projected the measure of a tax on gains in stake but expect an definitive decision of Mr. Paulson , who in 2012 's budget , has scored a coin of 8 percent for properties costing more than $ 2 million and the annual $ 2 fees for buyers who choose to possess the company in a individual company .
coin right already applies down from the residential properties of royal and UNK & Chelsea , and represents $ UNK million on a tax basis 2012 / 13 , this exceeds which total loan of Ireland 's North Ireland , the country of Ireland , the coast of Hawaii , the region and UNK , the region of UNK and UNK gathered .
Mr Cook said : " subsequent to a full increase of coin properties on large value and a release of the UNK bill in the terms , he is very difficult to progress that properties of entire value are UNK regardless the effects of a obsolete tax system . "
" but this change could attend foreign investors reluctant to buy a idea in the Paris properties or current owners reluctant to sell idea , " he said .
prestige housing -- to 5 percent of the 10 percent higher prices -- the housing market -- in prosperous area on southwest Paris who extends down to Chelsea of Wimbledon , has increased a record record of 10.9 percent on the period of last year .
prices in Paris 's center topped an regular growth year in $ 5.6 per cent but have been UNK by a " building market " in earnest growth , southwest of the city , ( 7.8 % ) and a is ( 6.5 % ) a recovery , according to UNK studies .
the scientists come in light light whose way whose movements tip a dog are related to his mood .
previous studies had revealed that happy dogs UNK greater tip toward their party ( the point of the dog order ) , while the dogs nervous more UNK around the right .
but now scientists say that dogs can detect these subtle differences and respond there .
UNK 's Ph.D. UNK , a UNK of Age University , said : " it 's knows that , while a man 's right head and right 's brain right are involved of different way in which UNK UNK the positive emotions or negative . "
next , we tried to see what he was in while other species .
he said that even that while a man , while dogs off the right brain was chief 's movement toward the right and supreme versa , and that both UNK played a different role in emotions .
for more in whether on the way including dogs reacted from tip movements UNK other dogs , researchers followed the animals in moving watching where the movies included other dogs .
they measured the stroke frequency animals and analyzed their behaviour .
he 'll definitely not long before that we UNK why their tip will sometimes a head and sometimes another of another .
UNK 's Ph.D. said : " we included to the dogs where movies included other dogs -- should be an evolutionary version compared for an silhouette avoid it another factor of confusion -- and we realized UNK 's movement of the tip and introduce as more range to right or right . "
when animals saw a dog without scratching the expression tip around the party ( the point of the dog order which UNK the tip ) , they are staying perfectly relaxed .
but when they spotted an tip pass primarily around the right ( still an right point of the order 's dog who UNK the tip ) , their cardiac frequency down and they had a nervous air .
UNK 's Ph.D. said he did not know that UNK dogs deliberately between them thanks to these movements .
he suggested that similarly dogs know by experience including movements they expected or will not worry down .
he said : " if you UNK to several other occasions and if you do that , the other time , the movement of their tip around a head is associate to an more exercise attitude and that right head faces an less exercise attitude , you UNK in full experience of this experience . "
researchers indicate that results could allow from owners , from veterinarians and UNK from better understand emotions of their animals .
expert in canine behavior Dick UNK , a professor invited at the veterinary School of Bristol University , said that this was not the first study to examine a importance of the right and party party while a canine species .
last year , an team of Lincoln University discovered dogs that ran the head around the right when they watched a aggressive dog and around the party when he did a cheerful dog .
and in another scientific study conducted by a University of Puerto on Canada , he said : " dogs would more easily around a robot dog when her tip UNK around the right suggested that around the party , on planned to become nervous -- a opposite of this one notable in a Italian study . "
he said differences might come that the made dogs have participated from different studies did not fully assumed the animals or movies like robots as the dogs .
an study on the way whose dogs react to draw real dogs could be useful , he explained .
" that 's some evidence , examined while different mammals , indicate that both the brain are used to different purposes , good number of details must still be disclosed -- and dogs don 't exception , " he said .
however , considered the readily the readily with which their behaviors can be recorded , he 'll definitely not long before why we UNK their tip sometimes a head and sometimes of another .

GM noted some of its new UNK from the United States for repair seats
General Motors Co noted nearly 18 million of its new UNK Chevrolet it UNK and UNK Sierra 2014 for a problem dealing with UNK manually issues , according Friday an press release of a U.S. responsible system of the safety of the vehicles .

blessing of desperation a Obama voter
I voted two times for Obama , believing in the plan a change
he said Obama has made the UNK efforts UNK by a UNK Republican Party
UNK didn 't excuse the GOP difficulties , neither drone attacks
memory of the 2008 Obama campaign is a sad recall of this would start up
UNK L Weiss is student in 3rd year medicine at the University of Harvard medicine .
I 'm moving in a UNK book read many sad recent .
it is a book , which I thought , UNK over the gloom of the 4th year medicine and UNK of me hope .
he calls down " The UNK Gone " and he ’ s the memoirs of the presidential campaign of Barack Obama of 2008 .
when I have gone medical UNK of my patients off and that I layer me , this book UNK me at where political policies UNK the million people and where speeches might cutting you off direction .
election is reached down by an overwhelming victory and presenters of the newspapers have taken a time to consider the historic nature moment .
my classmates hugged joy and my parents matched all papers that they found .
an 18-year-old team of visionary climbed around the administration and the nation was prepared for change .
during the period of a transition before Obama full its primary in 2008 , he had 78 percent likely .
and then I fresh book .
return on close is a difficult mood , as is bringing a dream .
he is difficult to remind these packing days a optimism , this are as distant memories , a sad recall the opportunities spent .
change is really down in years who followed the first time where I voted .
it had nothing to see with what I had conceived .
I nuts on a credit of major achievements , since passage of a UNK Child Act ( legislation on affordable care ) until Iraq mark our army , in contrast by the end " nor saw nor seen " and a assassination " Osama bin Laden .
most of I think , a UNK supporter has destroyed too some efforts aimed to make our nation progress in the works of immigration reforms , the health care of public and capital of Guantanamo , between other things .
but after repeated times has challenged a Obama administration draw to my peers and my colleagues , I ’ ll more to provide feedback .
I 'm on the fly political desperation .
Republican obstruction does not explain the set on voice foreign leaders , none other foreign attacks by children innocent the drones .
she does not explain that the National Security Agency collected the data on the private life Americans , neither the set in the UNK charges which suggests the government counts .
she does not justify a UNK assassination assassination , a U.S. citizen , no trial , nor a public plot and the public financing limit permitted over presidential campaigns .
she does not justify a findings who said a report that efforts to reduce the administration for media on silence are " more aggressive ... since Nixon administration . "
and , more recently , she does not apologize a failure of designing a simple Internet site over more than three years after the bill on a UNK Child Act has been ratified .
I don 't know if this is to what I 'd .
if , at 12 , I was supposedly understand that the governance might contradict political campaigns which the preceding .
obviously , the election primary is not predictable , so a political party and political events which produce out by clue , such as shooting , influencing our public conversation .
however , all examples that I 've documented may be in large part of a choice administration .
this is what bothers me more .
I have to new voted for Obama in 2012 , but not because I was gushed by her candidacy .
Mitt Romney included an agitated and little refined alternative who did not allow its policies or determine his positions .
I felt that Obama , elected for a second term in being freed of the future elections pressure , raised promises including it did talk since if .
yet , when a likely index poll has plunged into 45 percent this week , he is still more difficult to move 2008 to a year through this book .
he made me suggest numerous promises which are stirring up .
this week , I read the book part who described how Obama suffered a huge losses on Clinton gain from UNK of Massachusetts .
during a UNK meeting , he said to his team he did that they put up on the opportunity and remain faithful to their cause .
" I want we UNK us on our talent , " he said .
we must remind us who we are .
we click 5 years after , Mr President , and I 'm more than a deal with you .
order points votes in this comment are solely those of UNK Weiss .

magnate mining mining , which dismissed a carbon tax payment a $ 6 million loan , has made a new argument for a try to dismiss questions regarding a conflict possibility .
England 's United Tea could control until four votes on Senate , this could be crucial on whether to decide whether carbon bills and mining must be scrapped .
but Mr. Johnson has falsely that the ministers could have a conflict interest and has said that girls of Mr. Lilly were prepared to receive personally of these policies .
" he won a significant conflict interest when he will pay down parental rehab so if a of his girls is inside , he won a text interest in that she 's not earned or not a rehab , " Mr Johnson said .
two months after his election , the election commission officially said that Mr. Johnson has won headquarters of Golden Ranch by 49 votes , after recount .

girls General , J.D. and Meg .
this UNK election be withdrawn two months after voting is finished ?

an biologists team headed by the UNK Conservation Society of New York has identified an new species of mantle to tail on the UNK coast of Japan .
Simon UNK , overseeing scientific mission at Survey for the Conservation and a UNK and UNK UNK ( UNK ) goes for A Express on this discovery and says light process identification of new species .
the discovery of this new species mantle to tail you ?
it is an opportunity , but it does not particularly me .
if by spent , species have been described and identified on base UNK , UNK and geographic , today 's development of new tools that include the genetic we enables our learning in science of the classification species .
he is not a impossible reason that these progress in genetic and molecular biology put in the case or a classification affiliation to a species , an kind , an family even even a duty .
on the early century , UNK ranked animals , on base differences between the UNK species .
today , some of these rankings are handed in case in the progress of the genetic .
of the same way , two very others UNK have been awarded thanks to the genetic .
it is the case of which new species comes being identified .
he has an several years , the scientific community claimed two species belonging at this UNK : seals to tail the Pacific and dolphins to tail of a Atlantic .
recent analyses have given four species .
why is a discovery a importance as a UNK said the Conservation Society ?
a point of preservation order , he is key affect many genetic differences , order to protect a species and now its genetic UNK .
if this population was already known since long by researchers , they did not part that she went a new species , only listed to a new room .
until during , if a problem of mass mortality caused by an viral outbreak or accidental capture poses out in the country , we could have case to extinction a species , suggesting that to an local disappearance a population more largely spread on Earth .
this loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic .
an extinct is considered crippled or in ground extinction in the primary number of persons on Earth , it means the inventory , and of plans that she has to restore up to begin inventory neighbors .
for this is a species of Elena UNK , whose population of the new species discovery is meeting , his inventory is automatically becoming higher , the also most prone .
why is rare live of new species of sailors ?
sailors are located in top of the food network .
they lives in the distinct habitats , open , in whom he has some genetic exchanges between populations and persons .
this discovery of genes limit the creation of new species .
likewise , more closed ecosystems favored a genetic isolation , which can result to long-term creation of the new species .
he needs to know that marine middle is off less like seen .
it prefers to send the robots on Mars , that matter what grew in the enclosure , at only 11 miles of the surface of the sea .
it spending more money in the research of life on other planets that in the Navy research and he is big time that change .
